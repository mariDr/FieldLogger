# Field Logger
My mobile development assignment 2016
 
 Stores the data in a local database and has fields to record data for each of five different fields, representing different treatment to be investigated.
   -   The onBackPressed() method display the correct dialog information
   -   Pressing "OK" in the onBackPressed() method saves the SQLite database and exits
   -   The ArrayList values are set from the SQLite database entries on entry 
   -   The fields time/date and treatment data is updated when the Save Log Entry button is pressed
   -   Show Log Entries button works and shows all entries for that field and returns to the correct page
   -   Field logger data copied to email
   -   Message sent asynchronously using thread
   -   ProgressDialog displayed and email received
